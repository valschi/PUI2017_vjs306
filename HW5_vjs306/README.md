__For Homework 5 I worked with different people on different assignments.

__Assignment 1__
For Assignment 1 I worked with Matt and with Sarah.  Sarah showed us how to fit a curve into our histograms. Most of the assignment I was able to get it on my own, albeit it took me a long time. The Chi Square portion is still pending.

__Assignment 2__
For Assignment 2 I worked with Davey for the first portion (reproducing Federica's notebook). Together we went through the scipy.stats documentation and compared against the skeleton notebook. We then separetely built our Null Hypothesis and compared and discussed.

For the second portion of the assignment 2, which consisted of increasing the np for the binomial and the lambda Poisson I worked with Sarah, Marium and Kim.  With Sarah we discussed the expected behavior that we were getting, the tricky part was to get the arrays. For this Vivian and Ash helped during TA hours, as I was overcomplicating things for the Poisson array. For Chisquare we still saw it together and were able to reproduce similar to the provided code, but I still have my doubts on what is it reflected. For further reviewing the code Srikanth, Imran and I sat some time together to study.


__Assignment 3__

For Assignment 3 I worked mainly with Matt and Sarah. 
The most time consuming part was making sure the experiment was reproduceable, by means of accessing the data and storing into PUIdata. I ended up uploading the .csv raw files to my github just to be safe. 

Working with this data was interesting as it was less abstract than other assignments.

From a python perspective I was able to find how to remove all columns except the few specified, as oppossed to remove several columns by listing 1 by 1 . 

Together we merged the tables and did the initial plots it was actually fun how it was coming together.

For the modeling part Matt and I worked together again, also with Sarah and the other Matt.  Here the code was very similar to what we did in class, and the graphs looked alike, but quite honestly the concept was a bit blurry. 

On Wednesday Srikanth also helped me get better on the OLS and WLS, I had missed to do it per person ans also my scale need a better fit. I didn't have all the time to properly interpret the influence graph.
