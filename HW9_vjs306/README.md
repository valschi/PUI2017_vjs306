# HW 9 README

_Assignment 1_

I was tasked to review the plots by:

- Chang,Yuwen, ywc249, ywnch
- Pan,Kent W, kwp225, kpan125

As both students followed instructions I was able to locate their HW8 easily and proceeded with the review. Both markdown files are stored in both my repo and theirs. 


_Assignment 2_

I worked with Davey and Srikanth for Assignment 2. Tasks 1 - 4 we were able to code side by side and follow through and complement each other. It was actually a very productive session.  For Task #5 it was the three of us again but we struggled a bit more. Srikanth was able to figure it out with Matt's help. In retrospective task 5 does make sense but I felt more confortable during the coding of task 1 - 4 .
