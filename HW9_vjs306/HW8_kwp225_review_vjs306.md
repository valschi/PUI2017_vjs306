Plot discussed:

__CLARITY: is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?__


The plot is very easy to read from the get go. One can immediately distinguish NYC, the boroughs, and some smaller subareas. The plot contains a label for the data represented and an brief explanation on what it is that we are looking at.

__ESTHETIC: beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?__

The usage of blue and red, and different tonalities is contrasting and appealing and the legend in the top right corner contains the necessary labeling.

__HONESTY: is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?__

The plot is accurate to the data source, and this is explained on the text and a a link to an article backing up some obvious discrepancies.  This was very helpful and necessary.


__SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS:__

There are just some improvements that I would suggest:

- Adding a caption to the plot
- Perhaps the use of blue and red is subjective but in some scenarios red is associated with losses, and here it's an increase.
- The "blocks" depicted it is not entirely clear to me (other than Central Park) what exactly do they represent, or what was the criteria for the limitation. (This might be as I am not a native New Yorker, but it might be obvious otherwise)
