__Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:__

__Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?__
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

HO: The average reduction of fat % in the dieting sample is the same or lower than the fat % loss in the excercise sample. 
HA: The average reduction of fat % through diet control is higher than the fat % loss in the excercise sample. 

__Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)__
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children of smokers and non-smokers at age 1, 2, 3, and 4 years.

H0: The average IQ for children whose mothers smoke at least 5 cigarretes a day is the same or higher 
as the average IQ of childrens whose mothers do not smoke. 

HA: The average IQ for children whose mothers smoke at least 5 cigarretes a day is lower than the average 
IQ of childrens whose mothers do not smoke. 

__Food deserts contribute to the incidence of diabetes Food deserts are defined as parts of the country 
vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. 
This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.__

This is not a lab experiment, but you have data on the incidence of diabetes for the US population.



Testable Hypothesis: Doing diet reduces more body fat percentage than exercise. 

QUESTION: does proximity to violence
affect children’s development?
HYPOTHESIS: the reading test score of
children who live near the site of a violent
crime is lower after the crime occurred
