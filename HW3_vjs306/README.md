This is my ReadMe for HW3

__Assignment 1.__

Matt and I started working on it on Saturday after bootcamp.   Mainly the effort consisted of understanding the assignment and analyzing Federica's code. We discussed the Central Limit theorem and how as the sample gets bigger the mean of the sample gets closer to the mean of the population. We also used wikipedia to understand what the PDF's where for each of the distributions. 

I used the '?' for each of the distributions to understand what are the input values that each of the distributions was expecting, and Wikipedia also served to confirm the same. 

During Saturday we were not able to find a 5th distribution, but on Sunday Matt and Marium found that Gumbel distribution uses basic math. I wanted to calculate the euler constant using a particular formula or python function, but in the essence of time we just copied the value. 

__Assignment 2.__

For Assignment 2 I started with the download of the data on Sunday, given the difficulties with navigation straight on Data Facility, I downloaded the files directly from citibike. Important highlight is that I discovered not all files there are the same, some are .zip, some .csv.zip. The code as I currently have it works only for .zip files, if I wanted to be able to extract regardless I would have to implement like Federica does, but in the essence of time it will only work on .zip files. 

With Matt and Kent we agreed on the Hypothesis and Null Hypothesis to be around the Idea of womer riders are in average younger than male riders. I had trouble keeping up and fully understanding how to extract the data. Specifically using the .groupby commands. This was not easy for me to understand from what Matt and Kent were doing.  I understand the purpose of it, by looking at the outcome it is displaying the normalized number of riders per age.  

__Assignment 3.__

I was able to get the data and the Z-test during the class, working with Srikanth, so for the Homework I just worked on formally spelling out the Hypothesis.
