## Comments
##### CLARITY: 
- Given the simplicity of the plot, it is not difficult to understand the core idea to be expressed.
**Recommendation**
- If it was me, it might be adding a title to the figure, using a shorter statement to describe the figure.

##### ESTHETIC: 
- The color of base map in carto is mild, giving a soothing feeling. But I'm not so sure why New Jersey has more place names than New York City - after all, it's a map of New York City, so it's a little wired to see more place annotation in the left half of the chart than right half.
**Recommendation**
- In my view it would be better that there are more place annotation in New York City.What's more, if it was me, I would give a statistical range to the legend.

##### HONESTY: 
-I think there is a little confusion, when color gets lighter the amount of deaths gets larger,or when the heat point gets larger, the amount of deaths gets larger? This may draw a question mark on the honesty of this map.
**Recommendation**
- would it be better to give more textual annotations to this map?
